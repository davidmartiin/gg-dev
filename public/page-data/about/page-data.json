Her interest in Global Gardens began after moving to Tulsa to work in child welfare in 2016. Katherine saw the need for programs that would allow children to develop self-efficacy and that would also value space for children to grow outside of a school or home environment. Katherine believes that the impact of a program such as Global Gardens in a developing person’s life could be immeasurable, and she is delighted to be working with middle school students at the Asbury Corner site. Outside of programming, Katherine enjoys sports and board games with friends, playing with her ridiculously fun baby, reading aloud with her husband, and of course cooking and eating interesting food.</p>\n","wordpress_id":267,"acf":{"job_title":"Americorps Member"},"featured_media":{"alt_text":"","source_url":"http://ggardensdev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fullsizeoutput_74e.jpeg"}},{"title":"Bailey Veal","content":"\n<p>Bailey joined the Global Gardens community as a volunteer at McAuliffe Elementary’s after school program in January of 2018.
